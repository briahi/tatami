Tatami
================

Presentation
------------------

Tatami is a micro-blogging platform, for internal use inside a company.

Tatami is made with the following technologies :

- [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/)
- [Elastic Search](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) - version : 0.19.2
- [The Spring Framework](http://www.springsource.org/)
- HTML5 and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)

Tatami is developped by [Ippon Technologies](http://www.ippon.fr)

Current build status is available on [BuildHive](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/ippontech/job/tatami/) : [![Build Status](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/ippontech/job/tatami/badge/icon)](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/ippontech/job/tatami/)

Installation (simple, for normal users)
---------------------------------------

- Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/)
- Run Cassandra from Maven : `mvn cassandra:run`
- Run Jetty from Maven : `mvn jetty:run`
- Connect to the application at http://127.0.0.1:8080

To create a username/password, use the registration form. As we have not configured a SMTP server (you can configure it in src/main/resources/META-INF/tatami/tatami.properties), your password will not be mailed to you, but you can see it in the log (look at the Jetty console output).

Installation (advanced, for developers)
---------------------------------------

If you want to remote debug, don't forget to set up your MAVEN_OPTS accordingly :
```
export MAVEN_OPTS="$MAVEN_OPTS -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n"
```
And remote debug under your IDE on port 8000

If you run into some Permgen errors, don't forget to boost these parameters : PermSize and MaxPermSize. For instance : 
```
-XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
```
Adding this to MAVEN_OPTS is the simplest solution

If you want to look inside the ElasticSearch index, feel free to use [elasticsearch-head](https://github.com/Aconex/elasticsearch-head), by @mobz, under /tatami/etc/ as a submodule of tatami. 
```
# to setup the submodule 
git submodule init 

# and fetch the submodule
git submodule update

# otherwise, if you don't have cloned the repository yet, you can setup and fetch directly during the clone
git clone --recursive ${tatami_git_repository}
```
